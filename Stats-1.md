Calculate the mean, median, mode and standard deviation for the problem  statements 1& 2. 
Problem Statement 1:  
The marks awarded for an assignment set for a Year 8 class of 20 students were as  follows: 
6 7 5 7 7 8 7 6 9 7 4 10 6 8 8 9 5 6 4 8 

Mean = sum of all observations/ number of observations = 137/20 = 6.85 

Median =  7
arrange in ascending/ descending order = 4 4 5 5 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 9 9 10 
and find the middle point = 20/2 = mean of (10th and 11th observations) = (7+7)/2 = 7
4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10

Mode = Most frequently occuring observation = 7


Problem Statement 2:  
The number of calls from motorists per day for roadside service was recorded for a  particular month: 
28, 122, 217, 130, 120, 86, 80, 90, 140, 120, 70, 40, 145, 113, 90, 68, 174, 194, 170,  100, 75, 104, 97, 75, 
123, 100, 75, 104, 97, 75, 123, 100, 89, 120, 109 

Mean = 107.514
Median = 100
Mode = 75

Problem Statement 3:  
The number of times I go to the gym in weekdays, are given below along with its  associated probability: 
x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 
f(x) = 0.09, 0.15, 0.40, 0.25, 0.10, 0.01 

Calculate the mean no. of workouts in a week. Also evaluate the variance involved in  it. 

PDF is given as
<table><tr><td>x</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>f(x)</td><td>0.09</td><td>0.15</td><td>0.40</td><td>0.25</td><td>0.10</td><td>0.01</td></tr></table>
Mean  = Summation of (x* f(x)) = 0*0.09 = 43/20 = 2.15
Variance = (Summation of (x^2 * f(x))) - Mean^2 = 491/400 = 1.2275

Problem Statement 4: 
Let the continuous random variable D denote the diameter of the hole drilled in an aluminum sheet. The target diameter to be achieved is 12.5mm. 
Random disturbances in the process often result in inaccuracy. 
Historical data shows that the distribution of D can be modelled by the PDF(d) =  20e−20(d−12.5), d ≥ 12.5. 
If a part with diameter > 12.6 mm needs to be scrapped,  what is the proportion of those parts? What is the CDF when the diameter is of 11  mm?
What is your conclusion regarding the proportion of scraps? 

For 1st part we've to find integral of pdf for limits 12.6 to infinity. Because we're interested in knowing the area under the curve when x = 12.6 to infinity.

<sub>12.6</sub>&#x222b;<sup>&infin;</sup> f(x)dx = <sub>12.6</sub>&#x222b;<sup>&infin;</sup> 20 e<sup>−20(d−12.5)</sup>
= <sub>12.6</sub>&#x222b;<sup>&infin;</sup> -e<sup>−20(d−12.5)</sup> = 0.135
= 
---------------- needs to be answered

Problem Statement 5:  
A company manufactures LED bulbs with a faulty rate of 30%. If I randomly select 6  chosen LEDs, what is the probability of having 2 faulty LEDs in my sample? 
Calculate the average value of this process. Also evaluate the standard deviation  associated with it. 

Binomial --->
p(s) = .3 p(f) = .7
p(2|6) = 6!/ (2!* 4!) * .3**2 * .7**4 = .32 or 32%

2nd part ------------------------------->

Problem Statement 6:
Gaurav and Barakha are both preparing for entrance exams. Gaurav attempts to solve 8 questions per day with a correction rate of 75%, 
while Barakha averages around 12 questions per day with a correction rate of 45%. 
What is the probability  that each of them will solve 5 questions correctly? 
What happens in cases of 4 and 6  correct solutions? 
What do you infer from it? 
What are the two main governing  factors affecting their ability to solve questions correctly? 
Give a pictorial  representation of the same to validate your answer.

Poisson or Binomial

Problem Statement 7: 
Customers arrive at a rate of 72 per hour to my shop. What is the probability of k customers arriving in 4 minutes?
a) 5 customers, b) not more than 3 customers, c)  more than 3 customers. Give a pictorial representation of the same to validate your  answer. 


Problem Statement 8: 
I work as a data analyst in Aeon Learning Pvt. Ltd. After analyzing data, I make  reports, where I have the efficiency of entering 77 words per minute with 6 errors per  hour. What is the probability that I will commit 2 errors in a 455-word financial report? What happens when the no. of words increases/decreases (in case of 1000 words,  255 words)?  
How is the λ affected? 
How does it influence the PMF?  
Give a pictorial representation of the same to validate your answer. 


Problem Statement 9: 
Let the continuous random variable D denote the diameter of the hole drilled in an  aluminum sheet. The target diameter to be achieved is 12.5mm. Random  disturbances in the process often result in inaccuracy. 
Historical data shows that the distribution of D can be modelled by the PDF, f(d) =  20e−20(d−12.5), d ≥ 12.5. If a part with diameter > 12.6 mm needs to be scrapped,  what is the proportion of those parts? What is the CDF when the diameter is of 11  mm? 
What is the conclusion of this experiment?
Same as q4

c) Find the value of z such that P(−z < Z < z) = 0.99 

Problem Statement 11: 
The current flow in a copper wire follow a normal distribution with a mean of 10 mA  and a variance of 4 (mA)2.  
What is the probability that a current measurement will exceed 13 mA? What is the  probability that a current measurement is between 9 and 11mA? Determine the  current measurement which has a probability of 0.98.



Problem Statement 12: 
The shaft in a piston has its diameter normally distributed with a mean of 0.2508 inch  and a standard deviation of 0.0005 inch. The specifications of the shaft are 0.2500 ∓ 0.0015 inch. What proportion of shafts are in sync with the specifications? If the  process is centered so that the mean is equal to the target value of 0.2500, what  proportion of shafts conform to the new specifications? What is your conclusion from  this experiment? 
EXPECTED OUTPUT: This assignment consists of 1000 marks and  needs to be submitted in .ipynb/PDF format in the upcoming session for  evaluation.
